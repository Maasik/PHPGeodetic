# PHPGeodetic - Geodetic library for PHP
PHPGeodetic is a library written in PHP, providing a set of classes for the handling Geodetic of Latitude/Longitude and ECEF coordinates, and conversions between datums

This library provides methods for:

 * Conversion of angles (bearings, latitudes and longitudes) between degrees, radians, minutes, seconds and gradians.
 * Conversion of distance between metres and kilometres, miles, nautical miles, yards, feet, inches and astronomical units.
 * Conversion of positions between Latitude/Longitude and ECEF (Earth-Centred, Earth Fixed); and vice versa.
 * Helmert Translations for conversion between datums.
 * Great Circle distance calculations using either the Haversine or Vincenty formulae.
 * Calculation of Initial and final bearings, and midpoint value for great circle routes.
 * Calculation of destinations from a start point, initial bearing and distance.
